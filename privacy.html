            <h2 class="text-black text-2xl"><strong>Securing your privacy:</strong></h2><br>

                security. OnTimeCourer&#8217;s staff members are clients and data subjects themselves, of both

                any questions about how we can protect your privacy, please contact us at *email address*.</p>
            <p class="mx-3">In relation to this privacy notice, our data protection officer is liable for supervising issues. If you

                would appreciate the opportunity to address your issues so kindly contact us first.</p>
            <p class="mx-3">It is important that we have precise and up-to-date private information about you. If your private
                information changes during your relationship with us, please keep us updated.</p><br>
            <h2 class="text-black text-2xl">Third-Party Links</h2><br>
            <p class="mx-3">This website may contain links to websites, plug-ins, and apps from third parties. By clicking or

                third-party websites are not controlled by us and we are not liable for their privacy statements. We
                promote you to read the privacy notice of each website you visit when you leave our website.</p><br>
            <h2 class="text-black text-2xl"><strong>What kind of Data do we collect about you?</strong></h2><br>
            <p class="mx-3">We may gather, use, store and transfer various types of private information about you that we have
                grouped together as follows:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc mx-8">

                    numbers.</li>
                <li>Financial data involves details of the bank account and payment card.</li>
                <li>Identity Data contains first name, last name, username or similar identifier, and title</li>
                <li>Marketing and Communications Data involves your preferences in receiving marketing from us and your
                    communication preferences.</li>
                <li>Profile Data involves your username and password, purchases or orders you have made, your interests,
                    preferences, feedback and survey responses.</li>
                <li>Technical information involves internet protocol (IP) address, login information, type and version
                    of the browser, time zone setting and place, kinds and variants of browser plug-ins, operating
                    system, and platform, and other devices that you use to access this website.</li>
                <li>Transaction Data involves information on payments to and from you, as well as other details of

            </ul>
            <p class="mx-3">We do not obtain any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (including details about your race or
                ethnicity, religious or philosophical views, sexual orientation, political views, trade union
                affiliation, data about your health and genetic and biometric data).</p><br>
            <h3 class="text-black text-xl">Cookies</h3>
            <p class="mx-3">You can set your browser to refuse any or all browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are set or
                accessed by websites. If you disable or refuse cookies, kindly note that certain sections of this
                website may or may not work correctly. Please see our <a
                    href="http://ontimecourier.co.uk/cookies-policy/" class="text-[#FFB400]">cookie policy</a> for more data on the cookies we
                use.</p><br>
            <h3 class="text-black text-xl">Embedded content from other websites</h3>
            <p class="mx-3">Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded
                content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other
                website.</p>
            <p class="mx-3">These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and
                monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the
                embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p><br>
            <h2 class="text-black text-2xl">Data Security</h2><br>
            <p class="mx-3">We have put in place suitable safety measures to avoid accidental loss, use or access, alteration or
                disclosure of your private information in an unauthorized manner. Furthermore, we restrict access to
                your private information to those staff, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business
                need to know. Only on our instructions, they will process your personal data and are subject to a duty
                of confidentiality.</p>
            <p class="mx-3">We have established processes for dealing with any suspected violation of private information and will
                notify you and any relevant regulator of an infringement where we are legally needed to do so.</p><br>
            <h2 class="text-black text-2xl">Data Retention</h2><br>
            <p class="mx-3">We will only retain your private information for as long as it is essential to fulfill the purposes for
                which we gathered it, including any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.</p>
            <p class="mx-3">In order to determine the suitable retention period for private information, we consider the amount,
                nature and sensitivity of the private information, the potential risk of damage from unauthorized use or
                disclosure of your private information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and
                whether we can accomplish those objectives by other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
            <p class="mx-3">By law, we must maintain fundamental customer data (including Contact, Identity, Financial and
                Transaction Data) six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
            <p class="mx-3">In certain circumstances, for research or statistical purposes, we may anonymize your personal data (so
                that it can no longer be associated with you), in which case we may use this information indefinitely
                without further notice to you.</p><br>
            <h2 class="text-black text-2xl">Keeping your Data</h2><br>
            <p class="mx-3">We will keep your information as long as you have your account, or as long as it is necessary to be able
                to provide you with the services, or (in the case of any contact you may have with our Customer Care
                team) as long as it is necessary to provide only support-related reporting and trend analysis.</p>
            <p class="mx-3">If it is pretty necessary or required to comply with legal or regulatory demands, resolve conflicts,
                discourage fraud and abuse, or implement our terms and conditions, we may also retain some of your data
                as required even after you have closed your account or it is no longer needed to provide you with the
                services.</p><br>
            <h2 class="text-black text-2xl">What we might need from you</h2><br>
            <p class="mx-3">In order to help us confirm your identity and guarantee your right to access your private data (or to
                exercise any of your other rights), we may need to request specific information from you. This is a
                safety measure to guarantee that no individual has the right to obtain private information. We may also
                contact you to request additional data regarding your request to speed up our response.</p>
            <p class="mx-3">We try to respond within one month to all legitimate requests. Occasionally, if your application is
                especially complicated or you have made a number of requests, it may take us longer than a month. We
                will notify you in this situation and keep you updated accordingly.</p><br>
